# Number-Detector-RPi-
A CV project that uses a CNN trained on the MNIST dataset to detect numbers
I use the NMIST Dataset, the model files execute to create a .keras file which contains the weights for the CNN (The PyTorch file contains the CNN written in PyTorch, it can be adjusted to either save the weights into a .[file format] to be implemented into the OakD or PiCam file).


For launching the OakD file, you need to download dependencies from depthai.
